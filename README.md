My name is RAJ SINHA, a final year B.Tech student in the Department of Information Technology at B.I.T. Sindri, Dhanbad. With an agenda of developing and applying skills in the field of Data Analysis and its applications, which was one of the premier reasons for my choice of Information Technology in engineering. I am a programmer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details. Also I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more. As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.
